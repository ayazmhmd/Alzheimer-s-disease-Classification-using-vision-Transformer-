<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that is likely to grow, spread, and deteriorate. It causes our brain cells to die leading to complete loss of memory and physical impairment. As a leading cause of death in developing countries, estimates say that approximately 6 million people of 65 age and above suffer from Alzheimer's disease in the United States.
Here in this I have used vision transformer in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.<p>
